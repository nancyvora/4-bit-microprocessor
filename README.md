# 4-bit-microprocessor
This project implements a basic 4-bit microprocessor designed and simulated using Logisim, a digital logic circuit design tool. The microprocessor is capable of executing simple arithmetic and logical operations on 4-bit binary data, demonstrating the fundamental concepts of computer architecture.

# Key Features

4-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): Performs basic operations like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, and NOT.

Instruction Set: Custom instruction set supporting a limited number of operations (e.g., LOAD, STORE, JUMP, ADD, etc.).

Program Counter (PC): Keeps track of instruction execution order.

Register File: Contains a small number of 4-bit general-purpose registers (e.g., R0, R1).

Control Unit: Decodes instructions and generates appropriate control signals.

RAM Module: Stores both instructions and data.

Multiplexers & Decoders: Used for instruction decoding and data routing.

Clock Signal: Synchronous execution of instructions using a manual or automatic clock.
